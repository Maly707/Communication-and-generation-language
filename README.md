It doesn’t mean we speak the same language we will be able to understand each other well, there is some difficulty you will face like if this different generation or different education or where you come from. This study will focus in different generations, we will deep be looking at what is the difference between different generation by analyze the words each generation say and try to guess the age from the language or finding the best words we can use when we try to communicate with the other generation.
